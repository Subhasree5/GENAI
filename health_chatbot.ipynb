            "*   **Unexplained weight loss:** Losing a significant amount of weight without trying.\n",
            "*   **Fatigue:** Extreme tiredness that doesn't improve with rest.\n",
            "*   **Fever:** Fevers that are persistent or unexplained.\n",
            "*   **Pain:** New or worsening pain that doesn't go away.\n",
            "*   **Skin changes:** A new mole, a change in an existing mole, a sore that doesn't heal, or a yellowish discoloration of the skin and eyes (jaundice).\n",
            "*   **Changes in bowel or bladder habits:** Persistent diarrhea or constipation, changes in stool size or color, or frequent or painful urination.\n",
            "*   **Persistent cough or hoarseness:** A cough that doesn't go away or a change in voice.\n",
            "*   **Unusual bleeding or discharge:** Bleeding from any body opening (e.g., blood in urine or stool, vaginal bleeding between periods, nipple discharge).\n",
            "*   **Lump or thickening:** A new lump or thickening that can be felt under the skin, especially in the breast, testicle, lymph nodes, or soft tissues.\n",

            "Bot: Dengue (pronounced DEN-gee) is a **mosquito-borne viral infection** that is common in tropical and subtropical regions around the world.\n",
            "\n",
            "Here's a breakdown of what that means:\n",
            "\n",
            "*   **Cause:** It's caused by one of four related dengue viruses (DENV-1, DENV-2, DENV-3, and DENV-4).\n",
            "*   **Transmission:** Humans get infected when they are bitten by an infected **Aedes mosquito**, primarily the *Aedes aegypti* mosquito, and to a lesser extent, *Aedes albopictus*. These mosquitoes typically bite during the day.\n",
            "*   **Symptoms:** Symptoms can range from mild to severe. Common symptoms often appear 4-10 days after the mosquito bite and can include:\n",
            "    *   High fever\n",
            "    *   Severe headache\n",
            "    *   Pain behind the eyes\n",
            "    *   Severe joint and muscle pain (earning it the nickname \"breakbone fever\")\n",
            "    *   Fatigue\n",
            "    *   Skin rash (appearing 2-5 days after the onset of fever)\n",
            "    *   Mild bleeding, such as nosebleeds or bleeding gums\n",
            "*   **Severity:** While many dengue infections are mild, some people can develop a more severe form called **severe dengue** (also known as dengue hemorrhagic fever), which can lead to shock, internal bleeding, organ damage, and can be life-threatening if not treated promptly.\n",
            "*   **Treatment:** There is no specific antiviral treatment for dengue. Treatment focuses on supportive care to manage symptoms, such as pain relievers, fever reducers, and hydration.\n",
            "*   **Prevention:** The best way to prevent dengue is to avoid mosquito bites and control mosquito populations, for example, by eliminating stagnant water sources where mosquitoes breed.\n",
            "\n",
            "**Important:** If you experience symptoms consistent with dengue, especially after traveling to or living in a region where dengue is common, it is crucial to **consult a doctor immediately** for proper diagnosis and medical advice. They can provide the necessary guidance and care.\n",
